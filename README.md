This is my first OOP project created using Java
This project works to simulate a banking system
The project application gives the user the opportunity to perform various operations:
* Opening/Closing a banks account.
* Depositing and withdrawing money.
* Revealing the balance and all details of a specific account.
* Storing all data in a specific file.
